# InstacartBasket-Analysis

As an analyst at Instacart, I'm delving deep into their sales data to unveil concealed patterns. My objective is to enhance their market segmentation strategies through comprehensive exploratory analysis using Python. Keep an eye out for forthcoming insights that have the potential to reshape their approach and bolster sales even further.

**Instacart Data Analysis Project**

Within this project, I assume the role of an analyst at Instacart, tasked with delving into sales patterns and customer behaviors. The objective is to unearth invaluable insights that will drive improvements in customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.

**Context**

Instacart, a leading online grocery platform, is on a quest to fine-tune its marketing endeavors. Acknowledging the limitations of a uniform approach, they are eager to optimize their strategies. Through my analysis, I endeavor to carve out effective customer segments and recommend tailored strategies to boost product sales.

**Key Questions**

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
